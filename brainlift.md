# SpatialNotes – Brain Lift

## 1. Purpose
SpatialNotes is a next-generation note-taking and knowledge mapping application that leverages **spatial computing** and **large language models (LLMs)** to deliver an intuitive, local-first experience. Key features and objectives include:

- **Tailored User Interface**  
  The UI aligns precisely with the semantics of user interactions, eliminating extra interpretation.

- **Spatial Computing Integration**  
  Uses platform advancements in spatial computing for efficient content discovery and editing.

- **LLM-Powered Features**  
  Employs LLMs to generate, resurface, and categorize personal content directly on the client.

- **Local Data and Logic**  
  Maximizes local storage and processing for performance and privacy, relying on the database for integrity.

- **Platform-Centric Design**  
  Builds on platform-provided features, avoiding redundant per-app implementations.

- **Graph-Based Visualization**  
  Represents content relationships as graphs for natural navigation.

- **Single-Purchase Model**  
  Offers a one-time purchase, minimizing server costs and subscriptions.

- **Code-Driven AI**  
  Communicates with AI via code for efficient integration.

### Scope
- **In Scope**:  
  - Spatial computing interface for note-taking  
  - LLM integration with client-side API calls  
  - Local database for data management  
  - Graph visualization of content  
  - Platform feature utilization  
  - Single-purchase licensing  

- **Out of Scope**:  
  - Real-time collaboration features  
  - Cross-platform support beyond initial MVP  
  - Extensive third-party integrations  
  - Subscription-based monetization

## 3. SpikyPOVs

### Truths
- **Tailored UI** matches user interaction semantics for efficiency.  
- **Note-taking apps** remain unsolved, ripe for spatial and LLM innovation.  
- **Platform features** should handle major functionalities, not apps.  
- **Local data/logic** boosts performance and privacy.  
- **Graphs** are the natural way to see content relationships.  
- **Single-purchase** beats subscriptions for user experience.  
- **Code-driven AI** is the most efficient communication method.  

### Myths
- **“UI is secondary to function.”**  
  Tailored UI is critical for usability.  

- **“Note-taking is solved.”**  
  New tech proves there’s room to improve.  

- **“Apps should build all features.”**  
  Platforms provide better solutions.  

- **“Third-party tools always work better.”**  
  They often mismatch with platform integration.  

- **“Cloud is essential.”**  
  Local data can outperform and secure better.  

- **“Subscriptions are required.”**  
  Single-purchase works with low server costs.  

- **“Design docs drive AI.”**  
  Code is more direct and efficient.
